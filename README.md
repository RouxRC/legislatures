### Data Contributions

Data files are located in `public/data/` directory. To add or update data:

1. Follow the existing JSON schema
2. Verify historical accuracy
3. Include reliable sources with a "source" key
4. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Data Structure

There are multiple data files, which contain multiple data types:

```
legislatures/
└── public/data/
    ├── events.json             # List of historical events (avoid more than one per year)
    │
    ├── republics.json          # List of regimes
    │   └── legislatures        # List of regime legislatures
    │       └── parties         # List of parties elected during this legislature
    │
    └── currents.json           # List of political currents families
        └── currents            # List of political currents associated with this family
            └── parties         # List of parties associated with this current
```

Parties are both in `republics.json` and `currents.json` using the same id (`name`).
In `republics.json`, give the id (`name`), and the temporary datas:

- Number of deputies
- If the party is part of a coalition, name it

In `currents.json`, the id (`name`) associate the party with a current and its datas, but also with the party untemporal datas:

- Full name
- Keyword (Wikipédia article name)

Each entity requires specific mandatory fields (refer to TypeScript types).

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a core focus:

- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance
- Motion reduction support
- Alternative text for visualizations
